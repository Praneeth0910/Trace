We are building a solution called TRACE (Train Routing and Control Engine) for the AWS AI for Bharat Hackathon under the theme “AI for Communities, Access & Public Impact.”

TRACE is an AI-powered railway safety and traffic intelligence system designed to prevent train collisions, reduce routing conflicts, and improve operational safety in public railway networks like Indian Railways.

The system focuses on:

Predicting signal conflicts and routing risks

Detecting potential multi-train collision scenarios

Providing real-time AI-driven corrective suggestions

Monitoring congestion and network overload

Supporting centralized command and control dashboards

The goal is to enhance public safety, protect millions of passengers, and strengthen national rail infrastructure using AI-driven decision support.

TRACE will use simulated train movement data, signal logs, and route metadata to:

Detect unsafe conditions

Run “what-if” scenario modeling

Generate alerts and intelligent rerouting recommendations

The prototype will include:

A real-time monitoring dashboard

AI risk detection engine (rule-based + predictive logic for prototype)

Alerting and decision suggestion module

System architecture designed to scale across large railway networks

The primary impact is societal: preventing accidents, reducing delays, improving public trust, and increasing safety across high-density railway corridors in India.
